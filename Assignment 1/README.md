# Assignment 1 :

### Study Assignment: Compare different algorithms and evaluate their performance/cost. E.g. depth-first search (DFS) to heuristic algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS. Since all of the studied algorithms converge to a solution from a solvable deal, effectiveness of each approach to be measured by how quickly a solution was reached, and how many nodes were traversed until a solution was reached.
